Doople
=============

Framework for rapid development of bi-directional json-rpc over websockets.

Usage:

Three files are needed:

1. HTML file, put in the sites_html folder
2. Javascript file, put in the import_js folder
3. Python file, put in the import_py folder

If you look at the demo 'chat' app you will see that all three files need to the the same name (chat.html, chat.js, chat.py). You will also see how the files need to be formatted.
